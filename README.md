YogaPoints
==========

Second try with Qt. Database (SQLite), JSON, and charts

#The app

With this app, you can register your yoga score each day.
A *position* is a yoga position such as **Facing dog pose**. Points are attributede for each position (for instance 20 for **facing dog pose**).
You can add, change, remove positions and points in the *position.json* file (a feature allowing to manage positions directly in the app will come).

The aim of this app is to see your progress day by day.

#Next Features (current development)
* Won't reset database at each run... :-/
  * But a new feture allowing managing positions/series name and points
* Charts for week, month, etc. to view your progress
* Statistics, for instance most practiced position a week
* Mobile app
* Nice GUI... but not yet :-P
