YogaPoints
==========

Second try with Qt. Database (SQLite), JSON, and charts

#The app

With this app, you can register your yoga score each day.
A *position* is a yoga position like **Facing dog pose**, you attribute point for each position (like 20 for **facing dog pose**).
You can add, change, remove position and point in the *position.json* file (feature to manage positions directly in the app will come).

The aim of this app is to see your progress day by day.

#Next Features (current development)
* Serie: a bunch of position
* Don't reset database at each run... :-/
  * But manage position/serie name and point
* Charts for week, month, etc. and see your effort
* Statistics, like most practiced position by week
* Mobile app
* Nice GUI... but not yet :-P
